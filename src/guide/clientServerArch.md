1. Client REQUEST from server (Client ➡️ Server)
2. Server RESPONSE to client (Server ➡️ Client)
3. Client make use of data from Server (Text, Image, Video etc...)
4. Repeat 1 through 3

**Server RESPONSE with data when Client REQUEST**

## Daily Example:

1. Your laptop (client) request to YouTube (server) asking for data
2. YouTube (server) respond to your laptop with data
3. Your laptop (client) shows you the home page of YouTube
4. You click on a video, repeat 1 through 3
